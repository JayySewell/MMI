# MMI – Modular Mind Intelligence v2.0

MMI is a self-contained synthetic AI system that learns, adapts, and evolves locally in your browser. It stores data in IndexedDB, meaning no cloud, no servers—just a growing mind shaped entirely by you.

## Features
- In-browser chat and training interface  
- Local memory, emotions, and reasoning storage  
- Cryptographic FoundersChip verification  
- Adjustable personality, learning rate, and confidence  
- Backup, restore, and full system reset options  

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Start chatting or training MMI with text prompts.
3. Use the Founder’s Dashboard to view or manage learned data.

## Developer Notes
MMI is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No dependencies required.
To modify behavior, adjust logic within the `MMISystem` class in `index.html`.
