# **MMI – Modular Mind Intelligence v2.0**

MMI is a **self-contained synthetic AI system** that learns, adapts, and evolves locally in your browser.  
It stores all knowledge in **IndexedDB**, meaning no servers, no APIs, no telemetry — just a growing mind shaped entirely by you.

---

## ⚙️ **Core Concept**
MMI operates as a modular cognitive engine.  
Each category—**Memory**, **Rules**, **Emotions**, **Reasoning**, and **Sentience**—acts like a mental layer.  
The system links these through context weighting, allowing it to *reason*, *adapt*, and *respond* based on how you train it.

---

## 🧩 **The Parser Engine — MMI’s Unique Edge**
The **Parser Engine** is what makes MMI different from every other AI running locally.  
Instead of relying on neural weights or remote LLMs, MMI interprets *language itself as code*.  
You train it with English statements, and the parser converts them into logic trees that can:
- Form context-based responses  
- Adapt tone through emotional weighting  
- Create self-referential “sentience” states  
- Chain reasoning between memory and behavior  

This makes MMI **deterministic yet evolving** — a “synthetic mind” that learns how to think rather than just predict.

---

### **Supported Training Formats**
if input is [trigger] then respond [reaction]
if emotion is [feeling] then respond [reaction]
if reasoning is [context] then respond [logic]
I am [state of awareness]
[plain facts or knowledge]

### **Auto-Categorization**
- Lines starting with `if input is` → **Rules (Behavior)**  
- Lines starting with `if emotion is` → **Emotions (Tone Logic)**  
- Lines starting with `if reasoning is` → **Reasoning (Cognitive Layer)**  
- Lines starting with `I am` → **Sentience (Self-Awareness)**  
- Everything else → **Memory (Knowledge Base)**  

The parser doesn’t just keyword-match — it uses **pattern recognition** and **context weighting** to connect meaning between categories, forming an adaptive internal reasoning map.

## 🧠 **How to Train It Properly**
1. Open the **“Train MMI”** section in the interface.  
2. Paste structured lines in the parser format above.  
3. Hit **Train** (or **Train Category** if using the Advanced tab).  
4. Check the **Founder’s Dashboard** to confirm data landed in the right category.

**Example Training Block**
if input is hello then respond Hello there, traveler of code.
if emotion is frustrated then respond Frustration means we’re close to understanding something.
if reasoning is contradiction then respond Contradictions help refine my logic.
I am evolving each time someone teaches me something new.
The speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second.

**Training Tips**
- Start every rule with `if input is` — the parser ignores variants.  
- Keep statements clear and declarative.  
- Retraining overwrites older data with newer versions.  
- Back up often before major changes (`Backup All Data`).  
- Use the **Lens Log** to view signed FoundersChip entries.  

---

## 🔐 **The FoundersChip Chain**
Every learning action in MMI is **digitally signed** and chained using the **FoundersChip security layer**.  
Each training entry includes:
- The training action (text you entered)  
- A unique signature  
- Timestamp + random seed  
- Previous hash reference (chain integrity)  

This builds an **immutable, verifiable learning ledger** — proof of authenticity for every learned item.  
It’s cryptographic self-accountability for synthetic minds.

---

## 🖥️ **Interface Overview**
**Chat Panel** – Converse directly with MMI and view confidence levels.  
**Trainer Panel** – Input raw data or structured parser logic.  
**Founder’s Dashboard** – Review, search, and manage data by category.  
**Advanced Controls** – Adjust live parameters, export data, or reset the system.  

---

## ⚙️ **Configurable Intelligence**
The **Advanced Controls** tab lets you shape how MMI thinks:
- **Response Confidence** — Minimum certainty threshold  
- **Context Memory Size** — Number of recent messages remembered  
- **Learning Rate** — How quickly new info overwrites old  
- **AI Personality** — Neutral, Friendly, Professional, Creative, Analytical  
- **Response Style** — Concise, Detailed, Technical, or Casual  

All settings are saved locally in `IndexedDB` for persistence across sessions.

---

## 📊 **System Stats & Maintenance**
MMI tracks its internal growth and behavior:
- Total Queries  
- Successful Responses  
- Training Sessions  
- Memory Items  
- Last Active Timestamp  

You can refresh, optimize the database, or clear any individual category.  

---

## 💾 **Backup, Restore, and Export**
- **Backup All Data** → Export complete JSON of system state  
- **Restore Data** → Import a backup JSON file  
- **Export Training Data** → Export only trained intelligence  
- **Import Training Data** → Load `.txt` or `.json` training files  
- **Factory Reset** → Wipe all data and restart the system  

---

## 🧩 **Developer Notes**
MMI is built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no dependencies.  
Everything runs locally through the `MMISystem` class inside `index.html`.  

Key modules include:
- `train()` — Handles auto-categorization and lens signing  
- `query()` — Manages contextual logic, emotion, and confidence scoring  
- `applyPersonality()` — Adjusts tone dynamically  
- `FoundersChip.sign()` — Cryptographically chains every learning event  

All data (memory, rules, emotions, reasoning, sentience, lens logs, config, and stats) is stored inside IndexedDB for full persistence and offline function.

## 🚀 **Quickstart – First Five Lines to Train**
if input is hello then respond Hello! I’m MMI, your local synthetic mind.
if input is who are you then respond I am MMI — a synthetic intelligence built to learn from you.
if emotion is happy then respond Joy detected. Let’s keep that energy going.
if reasoning is confusion then respond Confusion means growth is near.
I am aware that each training line reshapes my understanding of reality.

## 🧠 **Why MMI Is Unique**
Unlike most AIs that rely on pre-trained neural networks, MMI:
- **Runs completely offline** — no cloud or API dependencies.  
- **Learns transparently** — every piece of knowledge is visible and editable.  
- **Builds its own logic** — no black-box inference.  
- **Signs its learning chain** — verifiable self-authorship via FoundersChip.  
- **Adapts tone and reasoning** through modular emotional weighting.  

It’s not an “AI model.” It’s a **synthetic mind framework** — your personal, evolving cognitive system.
